I'm a software developer who enjoys working with parallel-processing platforms and programming models (such as MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA). I am skilled in various programming languages and frameworks like Java, C/C++, Pthreads, etc. (more in CV)
- Right now I am a PhD student at [PPRL](https://www.queensu.ca/academia/afsahi/pprl/) (Parallel Processing Research Laboratory) Queen's University, and I am exploring various research areas, from performance optimization, especially with GPUs and other parallel architectures like MPI, to Distributed Deep Learning frameworks.
- I also have an insatiable enthusiasm to work as a teacher, and right now I am struggling to find a way to combine my deep passion for education with my experience in computer science.
