I'm a software developer who loves working with big data and parallel-processing platforms and programming models (such as Apache Ignite). I am skilled in various programming languages and frameworks like Java, C/C++, CUDA, etc. (more in skills section)
- Right now I am a PhD student at Queen's University, and I am exploring various research areas, from performance optimization, especially with GPUs and other parallel architectures like MPI, to Machine Learning and AI in general.
- I also have an insatiable enthusiasm to work as a teacher, and right now I am struggling to find a way to combine my deep passion for education with my experience in computer science.
