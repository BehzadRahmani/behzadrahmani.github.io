- Presently, a PhD student at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, involved in working on various research areas mainly focused on performance optimizations in MPI library. More specifically, improving GPU-aware communications in CUDA-enabled MPI, for both _point-to-point_ and _collectives_ communications and _message matching_ engine.  
- As a Software Developer, work with parallel-processing and big-data platforms and programming models (such as MPI and Apache Ignite) and have extensive knowledge in various programming languages and frameworks like  C/C++, Java, CUDA, OpenMP, etc.
- Possess an insatiable enthusiasm to work as a teacher in academia, and look forward to combining my passion for education with my expertise in computer science.
