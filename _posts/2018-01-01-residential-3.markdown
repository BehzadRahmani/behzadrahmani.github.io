### Project Overview

The architectural design process undertaken for the construction of twenty flat apartments located in the western part of Shiraz city, Iran. The design aimed to maximize functionality, aesthetics, and compliance with regulatory standards while meeting the client's requirements. The project involved the design of twenty flat apartments distributed across 5 floors, with four apartments per floor. The location in the beautiful city of Shiraz provided inspiration for the design, emphasizing both functionality and aesthetic appeal. the design process began with the generation of initial design concepts based on thorough analysis of client requirements, site conditions, and functional needs. This ensured that the design solution would meet the specific demands of the project.

 Conceptual ideas were translated into detailed architectural plans, drawings, and models. This phase involved careful attention to detail to ensure that the design vision was accurately represented in the final plans. Close collaboration with clients, project managers, engineers, and other stakeholders was maintained throughout the design process. This facilitated discussions on design integrity and project feasibility, ensuring that all parties were aligned with the project goals.

The initial architectural drawings were created using AutoCAD software, allowing for accurate drafting and detailing. This phase laid the foundation for further development of the design. Compliance with building codes, zoning regulations, and other legal requirements was a key consideration throughout the design process. The design was carefully reviewed to ensure maintaining all relevant regulations. In the next step Presentations were prepared and delivered to clients, stakeholders, and regulatory authorities to effectively communicate the design proposals. This facilitated feedback and approval processes, ensuring that the design met all necessary criteria. Comprehensive construction documents were prepared to facilitate coordination with consultants, contractors, and vendors throughout the design and construction process. Clear communication and documentation were essential for project success. The 3D drawings for this project were initially created in Revit. Once the models were finalized, they were then enriched and animated using Lumion software.
