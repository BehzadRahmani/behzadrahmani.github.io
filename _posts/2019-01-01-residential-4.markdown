### Project Overview

In the densely populated southern district of Shiraz, I undertook the challenge of designing a multi-story apartment building comprising 32 units. Given the economic considerations prevalent in this part of the city, the design strategy focused on maximizing space efficiency while ensuring affordability for potential residents. The layout of the building was carefully planned to accommodate the desired number of units within the available space. With five stories in total, the design allocated eight apartments on each floor. This distribution allowed for an optimal use of vertical space while adhering to zoning regulations and structural considerations.

Each apartment within the building was designed to be relatively compact, reflecting the economic criteria of the area. Despite their smaller size, great attention was paid to ensuring functionality and comfort for the residents. Specifically, each apartment was configured to include two bedrooms, catering to the needs of small families or individuals requiring extra space for living or working. Additionally, thoughtful design elements such as open-plan living areas, efficient storage solutions, and natural light optimization were incorporated to enhance the overall livability of the units.
